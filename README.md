Parallel Computing with Python
==============================

This IPython notebook illustrates a few simple ways of doing parallel computing. Based on the talk I gave at [CosmoClub](http://www.iag.usp.br/labcosmos/en/), [IF USP](http://portal.if.usp.br/ifusp/).

Practical examples included:

1. Parallel function mapping to a list of arguments (multiprocessing module)
2. Parallel execution of array function (scatter/gather) + parallel execution of scripts
3. Easy parallel Monte Carlo (parallel magics)
